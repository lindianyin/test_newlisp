Build newLISP on OS2

The quickest way to compile the OS2 version is by use of the gcc environment 
package by Paul Smedley (smedley.info). Install the GCC 335 build and folow 
the instructions.

If you want a different GCC released by i.e. Paul Smedley then install that 
beside the gcc 335 release. It is described how to do that. You can of course 
get gcc itself from ftp.netlabs.org too.

After the "make os2" from within your newlisp-x.x.x release directory you can 
copy manualy the newlisp.exe to a location, "make install" can be used to but 
the "guiserver" for OS/2 does not exist as java 1.5 is not ported yet to OS/2. 
"make uninstall" doesn't therefore work correctly either (this will be changed).

The readline library should be able to compile but is not included currently
in the makefile_os2 yet (working on it). The latest readline unix port for
OS/2 must be obtained v5.2.  But give it a try using the configure-alt script,
and contact Ted if it doesn't work.

There are some differences when using newlisp.exe in an OS/2 enviroment,
as you are working in a cmd.exe environment or bash. I'll try to define those.

Known issues in newlisp/2:

The newlisp functions 'spawn & 'share don't work, as the OS/2 gcc port doesn't 
have yet a good alternative for mmap. 'import is under investigation as it 
behaves strange with gcc 335.

newlisp/2 is tested and built on Ecomstation Rc2.
The port is done by norman at http://newlisp2.nodep.nl
